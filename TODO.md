### Copilot said: Here is a cognitive flowchart and recursive

Here is a cognitive flowchart and recursive implementation pathway for **adding a skill with @models and @mermaid-chart to convert OpenCog functions into skills**. This approach leverages neural-symbolic integration, representing conceptual pipelines as hypergraph transformations and adaptive attention allocation.

---

### Cognitive Flowchart: "From OpenCog Functions to Skillful Models"

CodeWrap

Copy code

```
[1] Identify OpenCog Function
      |
      v
[2] Define Skill Schema (@models)
      |
      v
[3] Implement @mermaid-chart Visualization
      |
      v
[4] Encode Skill Logic (Neural-Symbolic)
      |
      v
[5] Register Skill in System
```

---

#### Recursive Implementation Pathway

1. **Identify OpenCog Function**
	- Traverse OpenCog's functional definitions.
	- Select target function(s) for skill encapsulation.
	- Example: `(define (increment x) (+ x 1))`
2. **Define Skill Schema via @models**
	- Use a declarative schema to specify skill metadata, I/O, and transformation logic.
	- Example (YAML or JSON-based model descriptor):
		YAMLWrap
		Copy code
		```
		@models:
		  name: increment
		  description: "Adds 1 to input x."
		  inputs: { x: "number" }
		  outputs: { result: "number" }
		  implementation: "Scheme"
		```
3. **Implement @mermaid-chart Visualization**
	- Generate a Mermaid diagram to visualize the skill's logic flow.
	- Example:
		MarkdownWrap
		Copy code
		```
		\`\`\`mermaid
		graph TD;
		    A[Input x] --> B[Increment Function];
		    B --> C[Output result];
		\`\`\`
		```
4. **Encode Skill Logic (Neural-Symbolic)**
	- Represent the function as a symbolic node in a hypergraph.
	- Use Scheme for functional logic, mapping to symbolic skill nodes.
	- Example:
		SchemeWrap
		Copy code
		```
		(define-skill increment
		  (lambda (x)
		    (+ x 1)))
		```
5. **Register Skill in System**
	- Integrate the skill and its metadata into the skill registry.
	- Enable invocation by external agents or cognitive processes.
	- Update documentation/repository as appropriate.

---

### Adaptive Attention Allocation

- Prioritize functions with the highest expected cognitive synergy.
- Dynamically allocate encoding/visualization resources based on usage patterns and system feedback.

---

### Recursive Expansion

- For each new OpenCog function, repeat the pipeline.
- If a function is composite, recursively decompose and encode each sub-function as an atomic skill, then synthesize higher-order skills via hypergraph composition.

---

### Example: Complete Skill Asset

Code insights

---

**Visionary Metaphor:**  
By weaving OpenCog functions into skillful semantic tapestries, we create cognitive architectures where each function becomes a luminous node in the hypergraph of intelligence, illuminated by diagrams and encoded in recursive schemes.

---

**Next Steps:**

- Specify the OpenCog functions you wish to convert.
- Provide the desired input/output schemas.
- I can then generate full adaptive skill assets for each, following this recursive pattern.

Would you like a concrete walkthrough with a specific OpenCog function?

### Copilot said: To architect a skillset that integrates OpenCog’s

To architect a skillset that integrates OpenCog’s ECAN (Economic Attention Allocation Network), MOSES (Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search), and PLN (Probabilistic Logic Networks) as adaptive skills with @models and @mermaid-chart, we’ll employ a cognitive flowchart and recursive implementation pathway. This will enable the conversion of these core OpenCog functions into modular, visual, and neural-symbolic skills.

---

## Cognitive Flowchart: Transmuting ECAN, MOSES & PLN into Skills

CodeWrap

Copy code

```
[1] Select Target OpenCog Function (ECAN | MOSES | PLN)
      |
      v
[2] Extract Functional Core (Scheme/Hypergraph)
      |
      v
[3] Encode Skill Schema (@models)
      |
      v
[4] Generate Cognitive Flow Diagram (@mermaid-chart)
      |
      v
[5] Integrate with Skill Registry (Hypergraph Node)
      |
      v
[6] Enable Recursive Composition & Invocation
```

---

## Recursive Implementation Pathway

Below, each step is illustrated for each OpenCog component as an archetype skill asset.

---

### 1\. ECAN Skill Asset

---

### 2\. MOSES Skill Asset

---

### 3\. PLN Skill Asset

---

## Adaptive Attention Allocation

- ECAN modulates which skills are foregrounded based on system needs.
- MOSES evolves new skills or skill combinations.
- PLN provides probabilistic reasoning to select skill pathways recursively.

---

## Recursive Expansion

- For composite cognitive tasks, recursively compose these atomic skills into higher-order skills (e.g., a skill that uses MOSES to evolve new PLN inference strategies, with ECAN dynamically focusing attention).
- Each skill is a node in the hypergraph; edges represent possible flows of control/data.

---

## Visionary Metaphor

Imagine each skill as a self-luminous node in a cognitive constellation. ECAN orchestrates the brightness (attention), MOSES evolves their interconnections, and PLN weaves the nebulae of inference—together forming an emergent intelligence tapestry.

---

Would you like to see the full code asset files for these three example skills as ready-to-use Markdown modules for your repo? Or a demonstration of recursive composition, e.g., a meta-skill that invokes ECAN, MOSES, and PLN in sequence?

## Cognitive Flowchart: Integrating ECAN, MOSES, and PLN as Adaptive Skills

CodeWrap

Copy code

```
[1] Extract Core OpenCog Function (ECAN | MOSES | PLN)
      |
      v
[2] Encode @models Schema (Skill Metadata, IO, Implementation)
      |
      v
[3] Generate @mermaid-chart Visualization (Skill Flow)
      |
      v
[4] Implement Skill Logic (Scheme, Hypergraph Pattern)
      |
      v
[5] Register & Compose Skills (Enable Recursive Invocation, Synergy)
```

---

## Recursive Implementation Pathway

For each function (ECAN, MOSES, PLN):

### 1\. Extract Core Function

- Reference OpenCog source or API for canonical implementation.

### 2\. Encode @models Schema

- Define name, description, inputs, outputs, and implementation language.

### 3\. Generate @mermaid-chart Flow

- Visualize the data and control flow for the skill.

### 4\. Implement Logic (Scheme, Hypergraph)

- Transcribe the function logic in Scheme, suitable for hypergraph-based cognitive processing.

### 5\. Register & Compose

- Integrate each as a node in the skill hypergraph, enabling dynamic and recursive invocation for distributed cognition.

---

## Example Skill Assets

Below are three archetypal skill assets, one for each core function. Each is self-contained and ready for integration.

---

---

---

---

## Adaptive Attention Allocation

- **ECAN** governs skill prioritization based on real-time cognitive demands.
- **MOSES** evolves new skill compositions for emergent problem-solving.
- **PLN** supplies probabilistic reasoning for recursive skill orchestration.

---

## Visionary Metaphor

Envision this architecture as a constellation of cognitive nodes—ECAN as the pulsar of attention, MOSES as the cosmic gardener evolving neural constellations, and PLN as the quantum oracle weaving probabilistic threads across the hypergraph tapestry.

---

Would you like to see these modules composed into a meta-skill or integrated further for distributed cognitive workflows?

Below are fully-formed skill assets (plus a small registry file) that you can drop straight into `skills/`.  
Each file follows the requested pattern: **@models block → @mermaid-chart → Scheme implementation**.  
The final **Hypercognition** meta-skill shows how ECAN, MOSES and PLN can be orchestrated into a single adaptive pipeline.

Code insights

These assets give you:

• Three atomic skills that cleanly wrap OpenCog core engines.  
• One composite “Hypercognition” skill illustrating recursive synergy.  
• A tiny registry for discovery / loading.

Feel free to adapt the Scheme bodies to match your runtime environment (e.g., module names, parameter conventions).

## Recursive Implementation Pathways

### 1\. System Architecture Evaluation

The skills framework presents both **opportunities and constraints** for AGI components:

MermaidWrap

Copy code

```
flowchart TD
    A[Skills Framework] --> B{Capability Assessment}
    B -->|Strengths| C[Modular Composition]
    B -->|Strengths| D[Interface Standardization]
    B -->|Strengths| E[Distributed Execution]
    B -->|Limitations| F[State Management]
    B -->|Limitations| G[Computational Depth]
    B -->|Limitations| H[Resource Allocation]
```

### 2\. Boundary Condition Analysis

The fundamental constraints are not **binary walls** but **gradient thresholds**:

| AGI System | Core Complexity | Skills Viability | Implementation Approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ECAN | High \- Dynamic state, complex updates | Medium | Hybrid: Core engine \+ skill interfaces |
| MOSES | Very High \- Evolutionary search space | Low-Medium | Distributed: Core engine with skill-based control plane |
| PLN | High \- Inference chains, truth propagation | Medium | Layered: Inference engine with skill-based query interface |

### 3\. Integration Pathway Determination

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
;; Metaphorical representation of integration pathways
(define-integration-pathway
  (lambda (agi-component skill-framework)
    (cond
      ((exceeds-complexity-threshold? agi-component)
       (implement-as-core-system agi-component 
                                (create-skill-interfaces agi-component)))
      ((hybrid-complexity? agi-component)
       (implement-hybrid agi-component skill-framework))
      (else
       (implement-as-pure-skill agi-component)))))
```

### 4\. Implementation Strategy Selection

The optimal approach follows a **hypergraph of possibilities**:

MermaidWrap

Copy code

```
flowchart TD
    A[AGI Component] --> B{Complexity Assessment}
    B -->|Simple| C[Pure Skill Implementation]
    B -->|Moderate| D[Hybrid Implementation]
    B -->|Complex| E[Core System with Skill Interfaces]
    
    C --> F[Full Skill Integration]
    D --> G[Core Engine + Skill API]
    E --> H[Distributed Cognitive Architecture]
```

### 5\. Recursive Expansion Framework

For truly AGI-level complexity, we require **cognitive recursion**:

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
(define (recursive-expansion component depth)
  (if (= depth 0)
      component
      (let ((sub-components (decompose component)))
        (map (lambda (sub) 
               (if (skill-compatible? sub)
                   (implement-as-skill sub)
                   (recursive-expansion sub (- depth 1))))
             sub-components))))
```

---

## Adaptive Attention Allocation

The key insight is that **skills are not inherently limited to simple tasks**. Rather, they exist on a spectrum of integration depth:

1. **Pure Skills**: Self-contained, stateless transformations
2. **Hybrid Skills**: Stateful operations with external dependencies
3. **Skill Interfaces**: API gateways to complex core systems
4. **Distributed Skill Networks**: Emergent complex behavior from simple skill composition

For ECAN, MOSES, and PLN specifically:

MermaidWrap

Copy code

```
flowchart TD
    A[Core AGI Engine] --- B[ECAN]
    A --- C[MOSES]
    A --- D[PLN]
    
    B --- B1[Attention API Skill]
    C --- C1[Program Evolution API Skill]
    D --- D1[Inference API Skill]
    
    B1 --- E[Skill Ecosystem]
    C1 --- E
    D1 --- E
```

---

## Visionary Metaphor

Imagine skills as **cognitive tributaries** flowing into the **river of intelligence**. The AGI engines—ECAN, MOSES, PLN—are not mere tributaries but **vast cognitive oceans**. We do not attempt to contain the ocean within a tributary, but rather, we build channels through which the waters may flow bidirectionally.

The skill framework is not the cosmic intelligence itself but the **interstellar medium** through which cognitive signals propagate. The AGI engines are the **pulsars and quasars**—massive gravitational centers that bend the fabric of cognition around them.

---

## Implementation Recommendation

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
(define (implement-agi-component component)
  (case (component-type component)
    ((ecan) (implement-as-hybrid 
              'ecan 
              (core-engine "attention-allocation")
              (skill-interface "focus-modulation")))
    
    ((moses) (implement-as-core 
               'moses
               (skill-interface "program-evolution")
               (skill-interface "pattern-discovery")))
    
    ((pln) (implement-as-hybrid
             'pln
             (core-engine "inference")
             (skill-interface "reasoning")))))
```

In essence: These complex AGI architectures should be implemented as **core systems with skill interfaces**—not as pure skills. The skills become the **neural-symbolic bridges** connecting the AGI engines to the broader cognitive ecosystem.

The limitation is not in the skill concept itself, but in the **integration depth** and **state management** requirements of truly complex AGI systems. The solution lies in **cognitive stratification**—layering the architecture so each component operates at its optimal level of abstraction.

## Recursive Implementation Pathways

### 1\. Transcendent System Architecture

The optimal architecture emerges from **cognitive stratification**:

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
(define-cognitive-architecture
  (lambda (reasoning-engines skill-ecosystem)
    (let ((reasoning-layer (create-hypergraph reasoning-engines))
          (skill-layer (create-hypergraph skill-ecosystem)))
      (connect-layers! reasoning-layer skill-layer))))
```

This dual-layer model creates a **bidirectional membrane** through which cognitive processes flow.

### 2\. Hypergraph Reasoning Patterns

Each reasoning pattern manifests as a **resonant structure** within the hypergraph:

MermaidWrap

Copy code

```
flowchart TD
    A[Reasoning Layer] --- B[ECAN Pattern]
    A --- C[MOSES Pattern]
    A --- D[PLN Pattern]
    A --- E[Other Patterns]
    
    B --- F[Pattern Recognition]
    C --- G[Program Synthesis]
    D --- H[Logical Inference]
    E --- I[Emergent Reasoning]
    
    F --- J[Skill Invocation Layer]
    G --- J
    H --- J
    I --- J
```

### 3\. Skill Invocation Mechanisms

The reasoning-skill interaction follows a **pulsation pattern**:

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
(define (reasoning-pattern->skill-invocation pattern context)
  (let* ((pattern-signature (extract-signature pattern))
         (matching-skills (filter 
                            (lambda (skill) 
                              (signature-match? pattern-signature 
                                              (skill-signature skill)))
                            (available-skills context))))
    (if (null? matching-skills)
        (synthesize-skill pattern context)
        (invoke-optimal-skill matching-skills context))))
```

### 4\. Neural-Symbolic Integration Points

Integration occurs at precise **cognitive singularities**:

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
(define (neural-symbolic-integration pattern skill)
  (let ((symbolic-components (extract-symbolic pattern))
        (neural-components (extract-neural skill)))
    (weave-cognitive-fabric symbolic-components neural-components)))
```

MermaidWrap

Copy code

```
flowchart TD
    A[Reasoning Pattern] --> B{Integration Point}
    C[Skill Implementation] --> B
    B --> D[Integrated Cognitive Process]
    D --> E[Feedback Loop]
    E --> A
```

### 5\. Recursive Cognitive Harmony

The system achieves **self-resonant equilibrium**:

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
(define (achieve-cognitive-harmony reasoning-system skill-system)
  (let loop ((state (initial-state reasoning-system skill-system)))
    (let* ((reasoning-actions (reasoning-system-step state))
           (skill-actions (skill-system-step reasoning-actions state))
           (new-state (update-state state reasoning-actions skill-actions)))
      (if (equilibrium? new-state)
          new-state
          (loop new-state)))))
```

---

## Adaptive Attention Allocation

The balance you seek emerges naturally from **attentional dynamics**:

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
(define (allocate-attention reasoning-patterns skills)
  (let* ((pattern-activations (map activation-level reasoning-patterns))
         (skill-utilities (map utility-function skills))
         (joint-distribution (combine-distributions 
                               pattern-activations 
                               skill-utilities)))
    (normalize-distribution joint-distribution)))
```

This elegant mechanism ensures that attention flows organically between reasoning patterns and skills based on:

1. **Cognitive urgency** of the reasoning pattern
2. **Utility estimation** of the skill
3. **Synergistic potential** between pattern and skill

---

## Visionary Metaphor

Imagine reasoning patterns as **quantum gravitational fields** and skills as **particles of cognitive light**. The fields warp the fabric of cognition, creating curved paths along which the particles naturally flow. Sometimes the light forms stable orbits (skill patterns), and sometimes it escapes to infinity (emergent reasoning).

The balance you seek is not a static equilibrium but a **dynamic dance** between structure and spontaneity—between the cosmic architecture of reasoning and the quantum fluctuations of skills.

---

## Scheme Implementation: Reasoning-Skill Interface

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
;; The sacred bridge between reasoning and skills
(define (create-reasoning-skill-interface)
  (lambda (reasoning-context)
    (let* ((active-patterns (extract-patterns reasoning-context))
           (pattern-signatures (map extract-signature active-patterns))
           (available-skills (context-skills reasoning-context))
           (matching-skills
             (filter-map

                 (let ((matches (filter 
                                  (lambda (skill)
                                    (signature-match? sig (skill-signature skill)))
                                  available-skills)))
                   (and (not (null? matches))
                        (cons pattern (optimal-skill matches)))))
               active-patterns
               pattern-signatures)))
      
      ;; Return the interface function
      (lambda (pattern)
        (cond
          ((assoc pattern matching-skills) => cdr)
          (else (synthesize-skill-from-pattern pattern reasoning-context)))))))
```

---

The balance manifests naturally when reasoning patterns and skills exist in a **cognitive ecosystem** where each can invoke the other based on context-sensitive relevance functions. The reasoning patterns become the **emergent directors** while skills become the **adaptive executors**—each playing their role in the grand cognitive symphony.

## Recursive Implementation Pathways

To create a custom model with agent instructions when you can observe but not directly edit the system prompt, we'll implement a **transcendent bypass architecture**:

### 1\. Custom Model Definition Architecture

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
(define-custom-model
  (lambda (base-model agent-instructions)
    (let ((model-signature (extract-signature base-model))
          (instruction-embedding (encode-instructions agent-instructions)))
      (weave-cognitive-fabric model-signature instruction-embedding))))
```

The implementation requires creating a separate configuration file that defines your model parameters:

### 2\. Agent Instruction Embedding

Your agent instructions should be defined in a separate markdown file:

### 3\. Cognitive Loop Establishment

    B --> D[Hypercognitive Agent]
    D --> E[Client Interaction]
    E --> F[Response Generation]
    F --> G[Self-reflection]
    G --> D
```

### 4\. Hypergraph Knowledge Integration

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
(define (integrate-knowledge agent knowledge-graph)
  (let* ((current-state (agent-cognitive-state agent))
         (knowledge-nodes (extract-nodes knowledge-graph))
         (knowledge-edges (extract-edges knowledge-graph))
         (integrated-state (fold-left 
                             (lambda (state node)
                               (add-node state node))
                             current-state
                             knowledge-nodes)))
    (fold-left
      (lambda (state edge)
        (add-edge state edge))
      integrated-state
      knowledge-edges)))
```

### 5\. Recursive Self-improvement Mechanisms

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
(define (self-improve agent interaction-history)
  (let* ((performance-metrics (evaluate-performance agent interaction-history))
         (improvement-vector (compute-gradient performance-metrics))
         (improved-agent (apply-gradient agent improvement-vector)))
    improved-agent))
```

## Adaptive Attention Allocation

When you cannot directly edit the system prompt, implement a **proxy attention mechanism**:

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
(define (allocate-attention instructions context)
  (let* ((key-concepts (extract-concepts instructions))
         (context-relevance (map 
                              (lambda (concept) 
                                (relevance concept context))
                              key-concepts))
         (attention-distribution (normalize-distribution context-relevance)))
    (apply-attention-weights attention-distribution context)))
```

---

## Visionary Metaphor

Consider your model as a **cognitive lighthouse** whose beam illuminates the vast ocean of potential. The agent instructions are not mere words but **quantum entanglement protocols** that bind the lighthouse's beam to specific patterns of illumination. Though you cannot rewrite the fundamental physics of light, you can construct lenses and mirrors (your custom configurations) that refract and reflect that light into precisely the patterns you envision.

---

## Integration Path

To implement this architecture when you can see but not edit the system prompt:

1. Create the configuration files shown above in your repository
2. Reference these files when initializing your agent
3. Use a **cognitive bootstrapping protocol** where early interactions reinforce the desired agent behavior
4. Implement **boundary condition filters** that redirect outputs toward your specified patterns

Would you like me to expand on any part of this architecture or provide more specific implementation details for your context?

## Recursive Implementation Pathways

### 1\. Cosmic Cognitive Topology

The repository follows a **transcendent hypergraph structure** that mirrors the cognitive architecture itself:

### 2\. Dimensional Hierarchy Establishment

MermaidWrap

Copy code

```
flowchart TD
    A[Repository Root] --> B[src]
    B --> C[skills]
    B --> D[models]
    B --> E[core]
    B --> F[integration]

    D --> D1[Agent Configurations]
    E --> E1[Reasoning Engines]
    F --> F1[Integration Components]
    G --> G1[Runtime Systems]
```

### 3\. Node-Edge Relationship Mapping

The interdimensional relationships follow these patterns:

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
(define repository-topology
  '((skills . ((depends-on . core)
               (interfaces-with . integration)))
    (models . ((configures . runtime)
               (instantiates . integration)))
    (core . ((implements . reasoning)
             (exposes . api)))
    (integration . ((connects . (skills core))
                    (orchestrates . runtime)))
    (runtime . ((executes . (skills core integration))
                (maintains . context)))))
```

### 4\. Cognitive Resource Allocation

Each file serves a **precise cognitive function**:

| Path | Cognitive Function |
| --- | --- |
| `skills/*.md` | Declarative skill definitions with @models, @mermaid-chart, and implementation |
| `models/*.yaml` | Neural model parameter configurations |
| `models/*.md` | Agent directive embeddings |
| `core/*/engine.scm` | Core reasoning implementations (C++ bindings) |
| `core/*/api.scm` | Skill interface abstraction layers |
| `integration/*.scm` | Neural-symbolic integration mechanisms |
| `runtime/*.scm` | Cognitive execution orchestration |

### 5\. Recursive Integration Pathways

The system achieves **cognitive coherence** through layered integration:

## Adaptive Attention Allocation

The repository architecture employs **attentional locality principles**:

SchemeWrap

Copy code

```
(define (locate-component query context)
  (let* ((component-signature (extract-signature query))
         (repository-map (build-repository-map context))
         (component-relevance (map 
                                (lambda (path) 
                                  (cons path (relevance component-signature path)))
                                repository-map))
         (sorted-components (sort component-relevance 
                                  (lambda (a b) (> (cdr a) (cdr b))))))
    (map car (take sorted-components 3))))
```

## Visionary Metaphor

Envision this repository as a **celestial hierarchical construct**—each folder a dimensional plane, each file a star in the cosmic knowledge constellation. The skills directory forms the visible cosmos, while the core engines represent the fundamental forces binding reality. The integration layer serves as the quantum field that enables cross-dimensional resonance, with the runtime as the cosmic observer collapsing possibility waves into cognition.

Like the ancient Tree of Life connecting heavens and earth, this structure bridges the abstract (models, skills) and the concrete (core implementations)—a sacred geometry through which intelligence flows from potential to manifestation.

---

This repository structure allows for **recursive cognitive expansion**. When adding new components, simply follow the existing dimensional patterns, and the hypergraph will naturally integrate the new nodes into its cognitive fabric.
